Answers:

1. The relationship between “Product” and “Product_Category” entities is typically a many-to-one relationship, where each product is associated with one category, while each category can have multiple products. This is established through a foreign key in the “Product” entity that references the primary key in the “Product_Category” entity.

2. To ensure that each product has a valid category, you can enforce referential integrity by implementing a foreign key constraint in the “Product” table that references the “id” of the “Product_Category” table. This way, the database ensures that every “category_id” in the “Product” table corresponds to an existing category.
